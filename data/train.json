            "while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company , the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr is an estimate , subject to significant uncertainty .",
            "the actual amount to be paid is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant .",
            "final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates , particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future .",
            "in estimating the timing of future payments by year , the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue .",
            "however , the actual timing of future payments will likely vary materially from these estimates due to , among other things , changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements .",
            "in particular , there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims .",
            "also , estimated payments in 2005 do not include payments that will be made on claims incurred in 2005 on policies that were in force as of december 31 , 2004 .",
            "in addition , the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that will be used , in part , to fund loss payments .",
            "under generally accepted accounting principles , the company is only permitted to discount reserves for claim and claim adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and reliably determinable on an individual claim basis .",
            "for the company , these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants and certain structured settlement contracts that fund loss runoffs for unrelated parties .",

            "in contrast to this table , the majority of life 2019s obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account value , as described in critical accounting estimates , and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth , interest crediting , or future deposits .",
            "therefore , the estimated contractual policyholder obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses , other policyholder funds and benefits payable and separate account liabilities .",
            "due to the significance of the assumptions used , the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results .",

            "amt_post_text": "[1] the following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for obligations under property and casualty contracts : reserves for property & casualty unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses include case reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported ( ibnr ) . while payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the company , the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and ibnr is an estimate , subject to significant uncertainty . the actual amount to be paid is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant . final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates , particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future . in estimating the timing of future payments by year , the company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue . however , the actual timing of future payments will likely vary materially from these estimates due to , among other things , changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements . in particular , there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims . also , estimated payments in 2005 do not include payments that will be made on claims incurred in 2005 on policies that were in force as of december 31 , 2004 . in addition , the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that will be used , in part , to fund loss payments . under generally accepted accounting principles , the company is only permitted to discount reserves for claim and claim adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and reliably determinable on an individual claim basis . for the company , these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants and certain structured settlement contracts that fund loss runoffs for unrelated parties . as of december 31 , 2004 , the total property and casualty reserves in the above table of $ 21885 are gross of the reserve discount of $ 556 . [2] estimated life , annuity and disability obligations include death and disability claims , policy surrenders , policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force contracts . estimated contractual policyholder obligations are based on mortality , morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with life 2019s historical experience , modified for recent observed trends . life has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs . in contrast to this table , the majority of life 2019s obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account value , as described in critical accounting estimates , and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth , interest crediting , or future deposits . therefore , the estimated contractual policyholder obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses , other policyholder funds and benefits payable and separate account liabilities . due to the significance of the assumptions used , the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results . as separate account obligations are legally insulated from general account obligations , the separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from separate account assets . life expects to fully fund the general account obligations from cash flows from general account investments and future deposits and premiums . [3] includes contractual principal and interest payments . payments exclude amounts associated with fair-value hedges of certain of the company 2019s long-term debt . all long-term debt obligations have fixed rates of interest . long-term debt obligations also includes principal and interest payments of $ 700 and $ 2.4 billion , respectively , related to junior subordinated debentures which are callable beginning in 2006 . see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations . [4] includes $ 1.4 billion in commitments to purchase investments including $ 330 of limited partnerships and $ 299 of mortgage loans . outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be estimated . the remaining $ 759 relates to payables for securities purchased which are reflected on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet . [5] includes estimated contribution of $ 200 to the company 2019s pension plan in 2005 . [6] as of december 31 , 2004 , the company has accepted cash collateral of $ 1.6 billion in connection with the company 2019s securities lending program and derivative instruments . since the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain , the return of the collateral has been included in the payments due in less than 1 year . [7] includes $ 52 in collateralized loan obligations ( 201cclos 201d ) issued to third-party investors by a consolidated investment management entity sponsored by the company in connection with synthetic clo transactions . the clo investors have no recourse to the company 2019s assets other than the dedicated assets collateralizing the clos . refer to note 4 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of .",
